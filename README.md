A real model of a hospital database is a complex structure designed to store and generate medical information about patients more efficiently and to assist doctors in accessing it quickly. The database stores information about various components of a hospital, such as doctors, departments, nurses, and more, as well as patient admissions and medical histories.

A hospital is divided into departments, each with its own name. Each department contains products that help doctors in patient treatment, and the quantity of these products is stored in inventory. Each department can have doctors and nurses. A doctor can have multiple nurses in their team. Doctors treat patients by admitting them and creating a medical record that includes diagnostic information. Surgeons, who are also doctors, can perform surgical procedures on patients.

Patients receive prescriptions containing medications, have a medical history that records their previous medical conditions, and undergo laboratory tests, such as analyses.

A hospital database is used to manage patient conditions, treatments, and surgical interventions effectively. It also helps in listing patients based on the attending doctor, admission date, and discharge date. Additionally, it aids in managing hospital medications and inventory.

Overall, a hospital database is a crucial tool for maintaining and accessing medical information, ensuring the efficient operation of the hospital, and improving patient care.# Hospital-Data-Base
